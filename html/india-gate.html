        <h1>India Gate</h1>
        <p>India Gate is an iconic monument located in the heart of New Delhi, India, and it stands as 
            a symbol of national pride and patriotism. This majestic structure was built in 1931 and was 
            originally known as the "All India War Memorial" to honor the soldiers who laid down their 
            lives during World War I. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the chief architect of New Delhi's 
            city planning during the British colonial era, India Gate is a perfect amalgamation of British 
            and Indian architectural styles. The monument is an imposing 42-meter high arch made of red 
            and pale sandstone, inspired by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Its foundations were laid on 
            February 10, 1921, and it took over a decade to complete this magnificent edifice. At the 
            heart of India Gate, an eternal flame known as the Amar Jawan Jyoti (the flame of the immortal 
            soldier) is lit to commemorate the sacrifices made by the Indian soldiers during various wars 
            and conflicts. The names of more than 13,000 servicemen who lost their lives in the First 
            World War, the Third Anglo-Afghan War, and the Northwest Frontier operations are inscribed 
            on the walls of India Gate, making it a powerful tribute to their valor. Apart from its 
            historical significance, India Gate has also become a popular gathering spot for both locals 
            and tourists. Surrounded by lush lawns and tree-lined avenues, it offers a picturesque and 
            serene setting, making it an ideal place for picnics, leisurely strolls, and relaxation. The 
            illuminated India Gate, especially in the evenings, is a sight to behold, with crowds of 
            people from all walks of life converging to pay their respects and enjoy the ambiance. In 
            addition to being a symbol of remembrance and an architectural marvel, India Gate holds a 
            special place in the hearts of Indians as a reminder of their rich history and a testament to 
            the sacrifices made by the brave soldiers who defended the nation. It continues to serve as a 
            proud and prominent landmark that unites people from all walks of life in the spirit of 
            patriotism and national unity.

                Amar Jawan Jyoti, or the flame of the immortal soldier, is a structure consisting of black marble plinth, with reversed rifle, capped by war helmet, bound by four urns, each with the permanent light (jyoti) from compressed natural gas flames, erected under the India gate to commemorate Indian soldiers martyred in the war of the liberation of Bangladesh in December 1971. It was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on 26 January 1972, the twenty-third Indian Republic Day.Since the installation of the Amar Jawan Jyoti, it has served as India's tomb of the unknown soldier. It is staffed around the clock by the Indian armed forces.Wreaths are placed at the Amar Jawan Jyoti every Republic Day, Vijay Diwas, and Infantry Day by the Prime Minister and the Chiefs of the Armed Forces. On 21 January 2022 the Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate was merged with the Amar Jawan Jyoti at the National War Memorial.
